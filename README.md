# Algorithms and Patterns in Javascript

This is a **work in progress**.

It's going to be a collection of:

- common patterns for solving problems (**src/patterns** folder)
- common algorithms (**src/algorithms** folder)
- common data structures (**src/data-structures** folder)

The code comes with unit tests and coverage

## How to run the code

Just run `npm install` first, then `npm run watch`

The code comes with Unit tests (Jest) and coverage (Istanbul)
